HowardAI - Intelligent Chatbot Powered by Spring AI

This is my second project with spring. It's basically a AI chatbot but it has Howard Roarks sprit on it. It's direct, self-dependent.

Development steps:
- First step is the backend and API, make a API that connects with a LLM, I'm not decided that right now
	- Initiate a spring project in spring initializer with the dependencies:
		- starter web
		- data jpa
		- postgreSql
		- devtools
		- jackson
		- spring AI
- Initiate the front end, probably some thymeleaf for now, but might improve later to react
- Next step is the database connection, use postgres
- (optional) maybe some payment system, (Stripe / iyzico / PayTR)
- Deploy the project, use Railway
- You should have a Minimum Viable Product by now, you can improve from now on
